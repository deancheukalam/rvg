A very lightweight WordPress plugin that uses Post Status as a short description/to-do for your posts and pages.

== Description ==
= What does it do? =
Post Descriptions lets you add descriptions to posts and pages, which lets you do things like add small to-do's or don't-forget's for your team members or yourself.

= How does it work? =
**Adding post descriptions**
Post descriptions can be added from two places:
1. The Edit screen
2. The Quick Edit screen

**Checking Post Descriptions**
You can check your post descriptions in two places:
1. In the column from your posts or pages admin overview
2. As a post state (the bold text next to your page or post title)

**Enabling/disabling Post States**
When you add longer descriptions, your admin might get a bit cluttered. In those cases you could disable showing post descriptions in post states with a simple checkbox.

== Installation ==
= Installation =
After installing the plugin, you will only see a column added on the posts and pages admin screens. If you go to Settings > Post Descriptions, or click Settings on the Plugins page, you\'ll find a single option to turn on Post States. When you enable them, you\'ll see the description in bold after the page or post title.

== Screenshots ==
1. Add longer descriptions to the extra Post Descriptions column
2. Show small descriptions/to-do\'s by using Post States
3. A super easy and lightweight setup so you can start right away
