# Post Descriptions

A very lightweight WordPress plugin that uses Post Status as a short description/to-do for your posts and pages.

## What does it do?

Post Descriptions lets you add descriptions to posts and pages, which lets you do things like adding small to-do's or don't-forget's for your team members or yourself.

## How does it work?

### Adding post descriptions

Post descriptions can be added from two places:

1. The Edit screen
2. The Quick Edit screen

### Checking Post Descriptions

You can check your post descriptions in two places:

1. In the column from your posts or pages admin overview
2. As a post state (the bold text next to your page or post title)

### Enabling/disabling Post States

When you add longer descriptions, your admin might get a bit cluttered. In those cases you could disable showing post descriptions in post states with a simple checkbox.

### Enabling/disabling description columns

When you only use short descriptions, you might not want the extra column. You can hide this column by clicking the "Screen Options" box in the top right of your screen and unchecking "Description".
